Christopher Intagliata: We humans often navigate using road signs and GPS. Elephants, though?

克里斯托弗·因塔利亚塔:我们人类经常使用路标和GPS导航。大象呢?

Connie Allen, a **behavioral ecologist** at the University of Exeter in the U.K., says they **navigate over long distances** using their incredible memories. (An elephant never forgets, right?)

英国埃克塞特大学的行为生态学家康妮·艾伦说，它们利用难以置信的记忆力进行长距离导航。(大象永远不会忘记吗?)

Connie Allen: But it’s also been suggested here and there that maybe **olfaction** and sense of smell is critical to these long-distance movements.

康妮·艾伦:但也有人指出，也许**嗅觉**和气味对大象的远距离迁徙至关重要。

Intagliata: Allen and her colleagues investigated that idea by testing African elephants’ ability to **tune in收音，开始** on a very specific smell: urine. You see, elephants pee a lot—some 12 to 15 gallons a day --and that urine can contain an array of chemical cues.

印塔利亚塔:艾伦和同事们通过测试非洲象对一种非常特殊的气味——尿液——的感知能力来进行研究。你看，大象尿的量很大——每天大约12到15加仑——这些尿液中可能含有一系列的化学信号。

But first, they needed some pee. So they headed to a spot along Botswana’s Boteti River and waited.

但首先，大象需要上厕所。因此，它们前往博茨瓦纳博泰提河沿岸的一个地方等待。

Allen: We’d wait for elephants to **urinate** and, within 20 minutes, go and collect these fresh urine samples.

艾伦:我们会等大象排尿，然后在20分钟内去收集这些新鲜的尿液样本。

Intagliata: Then they set up camera traps on seven elephant trails. After observing the elephants’ natural behavior on the paths, they noticed that a majority investigated scents along the trail—especially elephants traveling alone—an indication, the researchers say, that scents may serve as **signposts*** along the trail.

印塔利亚塔:然后他们在7条大象的踪迹上设置了摄像头陷阱。在观察了大象在道路上的自然行为后，他们注意到，大多大象会注意道路上的气味——尤其是独自旅行的大象——研究人员说，这表明气味可以作为道路上的路标。

Next, they placed those urine samples along the trails. And they found that for at least two days, passing elephants trained their **trunks** on the samples—especially samples from mature adults—another indication that scent might be a **potent** navigational cue.

接下来，他们把这些尿液样本放在路边。结果发现，在至少两天的时间里，经过的大象用它们的鼻子对着这些样本——尤其是成年大象的样本——进行嗅，这是气味可能是一个**有力的**导航线索的另一个迹象。

Their findings appear in the journal Animal Behaviour.

他们的研究结果发表在《动物行为》杂志上。

Based on these results, they hope **conservationists** might be able to use elephant pee as a **decoy 美[dɪ'kɔɪ]**.

基于这些结果，他们希望**环保人士**可以利用大象的尿液作为**诱饵**。

Allen: If we can **trick elephants into thinking** the path of other elephants is going this way, maybe we can redirect them away from it at the moment where they are coming into conflict with humans.

艾伦:如果我们能欺骗大象，让它们认为其他大象会走这条路，也许我们就能在它们与人类发生冲突的时候改变它们的方向。

Intagliata: They’ll just have to see what happens, once elephants **get a whiff of that plan**.

印塔利亚塔:他们只想知道一旦大象**知道了这个计划**，接下来会发生什么。

**get a whiff of (something)**
1. Literally, to experience a faint odor or scent.
Yuck, I just got a whiff of dog poop. Did anyone step in any on the way home?
I think I'm getting a whiff of garlic from the broth—is that correct?
2. To receive an extremely small portion or sample of something desirable.
Health insurance, a company phone, and a pension plan? Man, I didn't get a whiff of benefits like those when I was working for the company.
He didn't patent the design, so he won't get a whiff of the money they're making on it.
3. To receive a very small amount of information, especially just enough to give someone an indication or inkling of something.


科学美国人60秒：交通减少令动物欢喜

This is Scientific American's 60-second Science, I'm Julia Rosen.

这里是科学美国人——60秒科学系列，我是朱莉娅·罗森。

Don't worry about why the chicken crossed the road—the bigger question is whether it'll make it at all. Every year, millions of animals get killed by vehicles in the U.S. But that road risk has dropped because of the COVID pandemic.

不要担心鸡为什么过马路，更大的问题是鸡能不能过得去。美国每年都有数百万只动物因交通工具致死。但由于新冠肺炎疫情，这种道路交通风险有所降低。

"We're aware of negative impacts on the economy, family relations. I'm sitting in my living room, and I don't see as much of my family as I normally would. You know, so there's a lot of negative impacts. But the positive impacts are becoming more clear. And that could really change the discussion after the pandemic—change some of our assumptions about how much driving we should do if we want to protect nature, wildlife, air quality, climate change, and **so forth等等，诸如此类**."

“我们意识到经济和家庭关系受到的负面影响。我坐在客厅里，见到家人的频率也没有正常情况下多。因此，存在大量负面影响。但正面影响正变得越来越明显。正面影响可能会真正改变疫情后的讨论，会改变我们的一些假设，即如果我们想保护自然、野生动物、空气质量、气候变化等，我们应该将驾驶控制在何种程度。”

Fraser Shilling, co-director of the Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis. When officials began issuing stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of COVID-19. Shilling and his colleagues quickly realized they were **witnessing a novel experiment**: What happens when we all start driving way less?

加州大学戴维斯分校的道路生态中心联合主任弗雷泽·希林说到。官员开始发布居家令以减缓新冠肺炎的传播时，希林及其同事很快意识到他们正在见证一项**新奇的实验**：我们都开始少开车时会发生什么?

The answer is a lot of things, including fewer accidents and lower greenhouse gas emissions from cars. In their latest report, the researchers found that driving less has also led to a dramatic decrease in roadkills in three states for which they had long-term data: Idaho, Maine and California.

答案涉及很多方面，包括交通事故减少、汽车排放的温室气体降低等。在他们的最新报告中，研究人员发现，在爱达荷州、缅因州和加利福尼亚州这三个他们拥有长期数据的州，少开车还令道路死亡人数大幅减少。

"It's actually the largest **conservation action** that the U.S. has ever taken, as far as I'm aware, since creation of the national parks."

“据我所知，这国家公园建立以来，美国采取的最大规模的保护行动。”

The team documented about **a third fewer** **collisions** with deer, **elk, moose** and other large mammals in the four weeks following shutdowns. If such a slowdown persisted for a year, 27.000 large animals would be saved in just those three states.

根据研究小组的记录，在停工停产之后的四周内，鹿、**麋鹿、驼鹿**以及其他大型哺乳动物的**碰撞，冲突，事故**率减少了约三分之一。如果这种停工持续一年，仅这三个州就有2.7万只大型动物会被拯救。

In California, the researchers also looked specifically at mountain lions. Some populations in urban areas are **at risk of local extinction**, and vehicles are one of the top killers. However, in recent months, traffic deaths of mountain lions have dropped by 58 percent, revealing an important clue about how to save them.

在加州，研究人员还特别观察了美洲狮。城市地区的某些美洲狮种群面临着区域性灭绝的风险，而交通工具是头号杀手之一。然而，近几个月来，美洲狮的交通死亡率下降了58%，这揭示了如何拯救它们的重要线索。

"Well, to keep them from going extinct or to recover them, we need to protect them from traffic. And that means we need to build stuff. We need to put in fencing along highways and crossing structures over the highways. And that's a big deal."

“为了使美洲狮名遭灭绝或恢复种群，我们需要保护它们不受交通的影响。这意味着我们需要建造一些设施。我们需要沿公路设置栅栏，并在公路上方设置穿越构造物。这是件大事。”

People are now returning to the roads as stay-at-home orders are **lift**ed. But Shilling **hopes some of the lessons might stick**.

随着居家令的解除，人们现在回到了马路上。但希林希望人们能接受一些教训。

"Yeah, I just say... I think we can grow from this. Having less impact on wildlife—everybody loves wildlife, you know—and if we can find a way to not kill them, it seems like everybody can **line up behind that**."

“没错，我想说，我们可以从这些教训中获得成长。对野生动物的影响少一些，每个人都喜爱野生动物，如果我们能找到不杀死它们的方法，似乎每个人都会支持。”

科学美国人60秒：森林变得更年轻也更矮

This is Scientific American's 60-second Science, I'm Annie Sneed.

这里是科学美国人——60秒科学系列，我是安妮·斯尼德。

They give us paper and fuel, as well as vital ecological services—like cleaning the air, storing carbon and providing habitat. We're talking about trees, of course. But changes to the environment largely caused by appear to be causing profound transformations in trees around the world.

它们为我们提供纸张和燃料，以及至关重要的生态服务，比如清洁空气、储存碳并提供栖息地。当然，我们说的是树。但主要由人类导致的环境变化似乎正在令全世界的树木发生深刻变化。

In a new study, scientists reviewed global research on trends in tree seedlings, growth and death. They combined those data with an analysis of deforestation. And they found that worldwide, older trees are dying at a higher rate than in the past due to factors like rising air temperature, wildfires, drought and pathogens.

在一项新研究中，科学家回顾了针对树木幼苗、生长和死亡趋势进行的全球研究。他们将这些数据与森林砍伐分析结合起来。他们还发现，由于气温上升、森林火灾、干旱和病菌等因素，全球老树的死亡率比过去更高。

"And most of the drivers of that decrease in large, old trees are increasing themselves, such as temperature going up, droughts are more severe, wildfires, windstorms and deforestation are all—although variable across the globe—they're generally increasing. And so both the loss has already occurred, but we expect more continued loss of big, old trees."

“大多数导致大型老树数量减少的因素都在增加，比如气温升高，干旱加剧，森林大火，风暴和森林砍伐都在增加，尽管这一切在全球范围的程度不一，但整体都在增加。因此，大树和老树的减少都已发生，但我们预计大树和老树还会继续减少。”

Nate McDowell, an earth scientist at Pacific Northwest National Lab, who was one of the study's authors.

奈特·麦克道尔说到，他是太平洋西北国家实验室的地球科学家，也是这项研究的作者之一。

"So if we have an increasing rate of death, particularly of the larger, older trees, what's left are the younger trees. So that's why, on average, through the loss of bigger, older trees, our forests are becoming inherently younger and shorter."

“因此，如果死亡率不断上升，尤其是那些较大的老树，那么剩下的就是年轻的树。这就是为什么，平均来说，随着更大、更老的树木的消失，我们的森林正变得更年轻、更短。”

This is a problem, because old trees are vitally important.

这是一个问题，因为老树至关重要。

"For sure, the increase in death does limit the carbon storage of an ecosystem and can force the system to become a carbon source to the atmosphere. The second reason we care is from a biodiversity perspective: old growth trees tend to house a higher biodiversity than young forests do. And the third reason is aesthetic: As a society, we care about these trees. We have national parks named after these big trees. So there's a personal reason for people to care about this as well."

“可以肯定的是，死亡人数的增加确实限制了生态系统的碳储存，并可能迫使该系统成为大气中的碳源。从生物多样性的角度来看，我们关心的第二个原因是:古老的树木比年轻的森林拥有更高的生物多样性。第三个原因是美学:作为一个社会，我们关心这些树木。我们有以这些大树命名的国家公园。所以人们关心这个问题也是有个人原因的。”
