For African Elephants, Pee Could Be a Potent Trail Marker

尿液作为大象行走的标记

Christopher Intagliata: We humans often navigate using road signs and GPS. Elephants, though?

克里斯托弗·因塔利亚塔:我们人类经常使用路标和GPS导航。大象呢?

Connie Allen, a **behavioral ecologist** at the University of Exeter in the U.K., says they **navigate over long distances** using their incredible memories. (An elephant never forgets, right?)

英国埃克塞特大学的行为生态学家康妮·艾伦说，它们利用难以置信的记忆力进行长距离导航。(大象永远不会忘记吗?)

Connie Allen: But it’s also been suggested here and there that maybe **olfaction** and sense of smell is critical to these long-distance movements.

康妮·艾伦:但也有人指出，也许**嗅觉**和气味对大象的远距离迁徙至关重要。

Intagliata: Allen and her colleagues investigated that idea by testing African elephants’ ability to **tune in收音，开始** on a very specific smell: urine. You see, elephants pee a lot—some 12 to 15 gallons a day --and that urine can contain an array of chemical cues.

印塔利亚塔:艾伦和同事们通过测试非洲象对一种非常特殊的气味——尿液——的感知能力来进行研究。你看，大象尿的量很大——每天大约12到15加仑——这些尿液中可能含有一系列的化学信号。

But first, they needed some pee. So they headed to a spot along Botswana’s Boteti River and waited.

但首先，大象需要上厕所。因此，它们前往博茨瓦纳博泰提河沿岸的一个地方等待。

Allen: We’d wait for elephants to **urinate** and, within 20 minutes, go and collect these fresh urine samples.

艾伦:我们会等大象排尿，然后在20分钟内去收集这些新鲜的尿液样本。

Intagliata: Then they set up camera traps on seven elephant trails. After observing the elephants’ natural behavior on the paths, they noticed that a majority investigated scents along the trail—especially elephants traveling alone—an indication, the researchers say, that scents may serve as **signposts*** along the trail.

印塔利亚塔:然后他们在7条大象的踪迹上设置了摄像头陷阱。在观察了大象在道路上的自然行为后，他们注意到，大多大象会注意道路上的气味——尤其是独自旅行的大象——研究人员说，这表明气味可以作为道路上的路标。

Next, they placed those urine samples along the trails. And they found that for at least two days, passing elephants trained their **trunks** on the samples—especially samples from mature adults—another indication that scent might be a **potent** navigational cue.

接下来，他们把这些尿液样本放在路边。结果发现，在至少两天的时间里，经过的大象用它们的鼻子对着这些样本——尤其是成年大象的样本——进行嗅，这是气味可能是一个**有力的**导航线索的另一个迹象。

Their findings appear in the journal Animal Behaviour.

他们的研究结果发表在《动物行为》杂志上。

Based on these results, they hope **conservationists** might be able to use elephant pee as a **decoy 美[dɪ'kɔɪ]**.

基于这些结果，他们希望**环保人士**可以利用大象的尿液作为**诱饵**。

Allen: If we can **trick elephants into thinking** the path of other elephants is going this way, maybe we can redirect them away from it at the moment where they are coming into conflict with humans.

艾伦:如果我们能欺骗大象，让它们认为其他大象会走这条路，也许我们就能在它们与人类发生冲突的时候改变它们的方向。

Intagliata: They’ll just have to see what happens, once elephants **get a whiff of that plan**.

印塔利亚塔:他们只想知道一旦大象**知道了这个计划**，接下来会发生什么。

**get a whiff of (something)**
1. Literally, to experience a faint odor or scent.
Yuck, I just got a whiff of dog poop. Did anyone step in any on the way home?
I think I'm getting a whiff of garlic from the broth—is that correct?
2. To receive an extremely small portion or sample of something desirable.
Health insurance, a company phone, and a pension plan? Man, I didn't get a whiff of benefits like those when I was working for the company.
He didn't patent the design, so he won't get a whiff of the money they're making on it.
3. To receive a very small amount of information, especially just enough to give someone an indication or inkling of something.


科学美国人60秒：交通减少令动物欢喜
=

This is Scientific American's 60-second Science, I'm Julia Rosen.

这里是科学美国人——60秒科学系列，我是朱莉娅·罗森。

Don't worry about why the chicken crossed the road—the bigger question is whether it'll make it at all. Every year, millions of animals get killed by vehicles in the U.S. But that road risk has dropped because of the COVID pandemic.

不要担心鸡为什么过马路，更大的问题是鸡能不能过得去。美国每年都有数百万只动物因交通工具致死。但由于新冠肺炎疫情，这种道路交通风险有所降低。

"We're aware of negative impacts on the economy, family relations. I'm sitting in my living room, and I don't see as much of my family as I normally would. You know, so there's a lot of negative impacts. But the positive impacts are becoming more clear. And that could really change the discussion after the pandemic—change some of our assumptions about how much driving we should do if we want to protect nature, wildlife, air quality, climate change, and **so forth等等，诸如此类**."

“我们意识到经济和家庭关系受到的负面影响。我坐在客厅里，见到家人的频率也没有正常情况下多。因此，存在大量负面影响。但正面影响正变得越来越明显。正面影响可能会真正改变疫情后的讨论，会改变我们的一些假设，即如果我们想保护自然、野生动物、空气质量、气候变化等，我们应该将驾驶控制在何种程度。”

Fraser Shilling, co-director of the Road Ecology Center at the University of California, Davis. When officials began issuing stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of COVID-19. Shilling and his colleagues quickly realized they were **witnessing a novel experiment**: What happens when we all start driving way less?

加州大学戴维斯分校的道路生态中心联合主任弗雷泽·希林说到。官员开始发布居家令以减缓新冠肺炎的传播时，希林及其同事很快意识到他们正在见证一项**新奇的实验**：我们都开始少开车时会发生什么?

The answer is a lot of things, including fewer accidents and lower greenhouse gas emissions from cars. In their latest report, the researchers found that driving less has also led to a dramatic decrease in roadkills in three states for which they had long-term data: Idaho, Maine and California.

答案涉及很多方面，包括交通事故减少、汽车排放的温室气体降低等。在他们的最新报告中，研究人员发现，在爱达荷州、缅因州和加利福尼亚州这三个他们拥有长期数据的州，少开车还令道路死亡人数大幅减少。

"It's actually the largest **conservation action** that the U.S. has ever taken, as far as I'm aware, since creation of the national parks."

“据我所知，这国家公园建立以来，美国采取的最大规模的保护行动。”

The team documented about **a third fewer** **collisions** with deer, **elk, moose** and other large mammals in the four weeks following shutdowns. If such a slowdown persisted for a year, 27.000 large animals would be saved in just those three states.

根据研究小组的记录，在停工停产之后的四周内，鹿、**麋鹿、驼鹿**以及其他大型哺乳动物的**碰撞，冲突，事故**率减少了约三分之一。如果这种停工持续一年，仅这三个州就有2.7万只大型动物会被拯救。

In California, the researchers also looked specifically at mountain lions. Some populations in urban areas are **at risk of local extinction**, and vehicles are one of the top killers. However, in recent months, traffic deaths of mountain lions have dropped by 58 percent, revealing an important clue about how to save them.

在加州，研究人员还特别观察了美洲狮。城市地区的某些美洲狮种群面临着区域性灭绝的风险，而交通工具是头号杀手之一。然而，近几个月来，美洲狮的交通死亡率下降了58%，这揭示了如何拯救它们的重要线索。

"Well, to keep them from going extinct or to recover them, we need to protect them from traffic. And that means we need to build stuff. We need to put in fencing along highways and crossing structures over the highways. And that's a big deal."

“为了使美洲狮名遭灭绝或恢复种群，我们需要保护它们不受交通的影响。这意味着我们需要建造一些设施。我们需要沿公路设置栅栏，并在公路上方设置穿越构造物。这是件大事。”

People are now returning to the roads as stay-at-home orders are **lift**ed. But Shilling **hopes some of the lessons might stick**.

随着居家令的解除，人们现在回到了马路上。但希林希望人们能接受一些教训。

"Yeah, I just say... I think we can grow from this. Having less impact on wildlife—everybody loves wildlife, you know—and if we can find a way to not kill them, it seems like everybody can **line up behind that**."

“没错，我想说，我们可以从这些教训中获得成长。对野生动物的影响少一些，每个人都喜爱野生动物，如果我们能找到不杀死它们的方法，似乎每个人都会支持。”

科学美国人60秒：森林变得更年轻也更矮

This is Scientific American's 60-second Science, I'm Annie Sneed.

这里是科学美国人——60秒科学系列，我是安妮·斯尼德。

They give us paper and fuel, as well as **vital ecological services**—like cleaning the air, storing carbon and providing habitat. We're talking about trees, of course. But changes to the environment largely caused by humans appear to be causing **profound transformations** in trees around the world.

它们为我们提供纸张和燃料，以及至关重要的生态服务，比如清洁空气、储存碳并提供栖息地。当然，我们说的是树。但主要由人类导致的环境变化似乎正在令全世界的树木发生**深刻(巨大的；深切的；深远的)变化**。

In a new study, scientists reviewed global research on trends in tree **seedlings**, growth and death. They combined those data with an analysis of **deforestation**. And they found that worldwide, older trees are dying at a higher rate than in the past due to factors like rising air temperature, wildfires, drought and **pathogen**s.

在一项新研究中，科学家回顾了针对树木幼苗、生长和死亡趋势进行的全球研究。他们将这些数据与森林砍伐分析结合起来。他们还发现，由于气温上升、森林火灾、干旱和**病菌**等因素，全球老树的死亡率比过去更高。

"And most of the **drivers of** that decrease in large, old trees are increasing themselves, such as temperature going up, droughts are more severe, wildfires, windstorms and deforestation are all—although variable across the globe—they're generally increasing. And so both the loss has already occurred, but we expect more continued loss of big, old trees."

“大多数导致大型老树数量减少的因素都在增加，比如气温升高，干旱加剧，森林大火，风暴和森林砍伐都在增加，尽管这一切在全球范围的程度不一，但整体都在增加。因此，大树和老树的减少都已发生，但我们预计大树和老树还会继续减少。”

Nate McDowell, an earth scientist at Pacific Northwest National Lab, who was one of the study's authors.

奈特·麦克道尔说到，他是太平洋西北国家实验室的地球科学家，也是这项研究的作者之一。

"So if we have an increasing rate of death, particularly of the larger, older trees, what's left are the younger trees. So that's why, on average, through the loss of bigger, older trees, our forests are becoming **inherently adv.内在；固有；本来；从根本上说** younger and shorter."

“因此，如果死亡率不断上升，尤其是那些较大的老树，那么剩下的就是年轻的树。这就是为什么，平均来说，随着更大、更老的树木的消失，我们的森林正变得更年轻、更短。”

This is a problem, because old trees are **vitally important**.

这是一个问题，因为老树**非常\至关重要**。

"For sure, the increase in death does limit the carbon storage of an ecosystem and can force the system to become a carbon source to the atmosphere. The second reason we care is from a **biodiversity** perspective: old growth trees tend to **house a higher biodiversity** than young forests do. And the third reason is **aesthetic**: As a society, we care about these trees. We have national parks named after these big trees. So there's a personal reason for people to care about this as well."

“可以肯定的是，死亡人数的增加确实限制了生态系统的碳储存，并可能迫使该系统成为大气中的碳源。从生物多样性的角度来看，我们关心的第二个原因是:古老的树木比年轻的森林拥有更高的生物多样性。第三个原因是**美学美[es'θetɪk]英[iːs'θetɪk] n.美学；美感；审美观 adj.审美的；有审美观点的；美学的；艺术的**:作为一个社会，我们关心这些树木。我们有以这些大树命名的国家公园。所以人们关心这个问题也是有个人原因的。”


科学美国人60秒：濒临灭绝的鸟儿忘记了自己的歌声

These Endangered Birds Are Forgetting Their Songs
=

Some birds are relatively easy to study. Ross Crates studies the ones that aren’t. He’s part of the Difficult Bird Research Group at the Australian National University.

有些鸟类比较容易研究。罗斯·克拉茨研究的是那些不易研究的鸟类。克拉茨是澳大利亚国立大学难鸟研究小组的成员。

“All our study species are quite challenging to study for various reasons, mostly because they’re really rare and **highly mobile**.”

由于各种原因，我们所有的研究物种都非常具有挑战性，主要是因为它们非常稀少，而且**高度流动性**。”

One of those “difficult birds” is the **critically endangered** regent honeyeater. They’re medium-sized songbirds—with bright yellow tails and black-and-white chests. And though they once **roam**ed Australia **in flocks of hundreds**, fewer than 300 remain in the wild today.

critical
英 [ˈkrɪtɪkl]  美 [ˈkrɪtɪkl] 
adj. 鉴定的；[核] 临界的；批评的，爱挑剔的；危险的；决定性的；评论的
critically
英 [ˈkrɪtɪkli]  美 [ˈkrɪtɪkli] 
adv. 精密地；危急地；严重地；批评性地；用钻研眼光地；很大程度上；极为重要地

其中一种“难对付的鸟类”是极度濒危的摄政蜜雀。它们是中型的鸣禽，有亮黄色的尾巴和黑白相间的胸脯。虽然它们曾经数百只成群在澳大利亚**游荡/流浪**，但如今仍存活在野外的不到300只。

Crates and his team tracked the birds over a five-year period. If they encountered a male, they’d record his song.

克拉茨和他的团队在5年的时间里追踪了这些鸟。如果遇到一只雄性，就会录下它的歌声。

[CLIP: Proper song]

And they noted whether the males **were paired up with** females.

他们注意到这些雄性是否与雌性**配对**。

They found that a quarter of the birds sang variations of the traditional honeyeater song. And 12 percent of the birds weren’t singing honeyeater songs at all. They were **parrot**ing different species’ songs—like this ...

他们发现，四分之一的鸟会发出不同形式的传统的蜜鸟叫声。还有12%的鸟儿根本不唱蜜鸟的歌。它们在**鹦鹉学舌地模仿**不同物种的叫声——就像这样……

[CLIP: Little friarbird]

... or this.

或者这样。

[CLIP: Little wattlebird]

That could mean bad news for the birds’ future—because males singing those untraditional songs were also less likely to be paired up with a mate, compared to their **counterparts n. 副本；配对物；极相似的人或物** who sang the standard tune.

这对鸟儿的未来来说可能是个坏消息——因为与那些唱标准曲调的鸟儿相比，唱那些非传统歌曲的雄性鸟儿也不太可能找到配偶。

“As females breed less, then there’s obviously fewer males in that generation to teach the next generation. A higher proportion of males sing weird songs. And you get a bit of a positive feedback toward extinction.”

“随着雌性繁殖的减少，用来教育下一代的雄性就明显减少了。”更大比例的雄性会唱奇怪的歌。物种灭绝，你会得到一些积极反馈。”

\

The work appears in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

这项研究发表在《英国皇家学会学报B》上。

Crates says the honeyeaters’ loss of songs **equate**s to a loss of culture.

拉茨说，这些鸟失去了歌声就等于失去了文化。

“It’s **a complete sort of**, you know, animal equivalent of the loss of **Indigenous languages**, whether that be Native American languages or Aboriginal Australian languages here.”
**a sort of 有种，有点儿**
 
这就相当于动物失去了自己的**本土语言**，无论是本土梅雨还是土著澳大利亚语。

He says he hopes it **serves as a warning** that all is not well in Australia’s natural world—and that we must do more to **tackle** climate change and conservation if we hope to save it.

克拉茨表示，他希望这项研究并不只是适用于澳大利亚——如果想解决这个问题，以**应对/应付**气候变化、保护物种，我们必须作出更多努力。

科学美国人60秒: 蜜蜂和它的肠道微生物
=
**Beehives n. 蜂窝；蜂箱** Are Held Together by Their **Mutual adj. 共同的；相互的，彼此的 Gut Microbes**

Every **honeybee colony** has its own unique scent like a fingerprint. And bees use that scent to recognize their nest mates—basically saying, “You smell like me, so I’m going to let you into the colony.”

就像人类的指纹一样，每个蜂群(n. 殖民地；移民队；种群；动物栖息地)都有自己独特的气味。蜜蜂利用这种气味来识别它们的巢穴同伴——基本上就是在说:“你闻起来跟我其为一样，所以我会让你进入蜂巢。”

But here’s the mystery: If you transfer a baby bee into a new hive, not only does the colony accept it, but that bee will eventually smell like its adopted nest mates—even though they’re not genetically related.

但这里有个秘密:如果你把一只小蜜蜂转移到一个新的蜂巢，不仅新的蜂巢会接受了它，而且这只蜜蜂最终的气味也会和它被收养的蜂巢同伴一样——即使它们没有血缘关系。

“**This kind of got us thinking**, ‘Perhaps it’s not actually the genetics of the bee; it’s actually the genetics of the microbes that live within the bee.’”

“这让我们思考，‘也许这实际上不是蜜蜂的基因;这实际上是生活在蜜蜂体内的微生物的基因。’”

Cassondra Vernier is a **postdoctoral researcher** [now] at the University of Illinois. She knew gut microbes can affect the scent and communication of other animals, like hyenas.

Cassondra Vernier是伊利诺伊大学的**博士后研究员**。她知道肠道微生物可以影响其他动物的气味和沟通交流，比如鬣狗。

So she and her **co-authors** designed a series of experiments to test whether microbes also change the **scent compounds** **coating** the outside of honeybees, known as cuticular hydrocarbons.

因此，她和合著者设计了一系列实验，测试微生物是否也会改变蜜蜂表面的气味化合物--表皮碳氢化合物。

In one experiment, they fed different gut microbes to newly hatched sister bees. The bees developed **distinct** **microbiome**s—and they also produced different cuticular hydrocarbon scents. On the other hand ...

在一项实验中，他们给新孵化的姐妹蜂喂食不同的肠道微生物。这些蜜蜂进化出了**不同(adj. 明显的；独特的；清楚的；有区别的)的** **微生物群**——它们也产生了不同的表皮碳氢化合物气味。另一方面…

“If they were treated with different **inoculums**, they recognized each other as non-nest mates. And they attacked each other, usually in the form of biting each other.”

“如果给它们注射不同的n. 接种体；培养液[ 复数 inocula ]，它们就能认出彼此是没有巢的伴侣。就会互相攻击，通常是互相咬对方。”

In other words, bees from the same colony did not recognize each other when they had different gut microbes.

换句话说，当来自同一个蜂群的蜜蜂拥有不同的肠道微生物时，它们无法识别彼此。

Washington University [in St. Louis] biology professor and co-author Yehuda Ben-Shahar says the microbes are changing the bees **physiologically** and controlling their complicated social behaviors. But he adds this relationship is mutually beneficial for the bacteria and the bees.

圣路易斯华盛顿大学的生物学教授、合著者本-沙哈尔说，这些微生物正在从**生理学上**改变蜜蜂，并控制它们复杂的社会行为。但他补充说，这种关系对细菌和蜜蜂来说是互惠互利的。

“The bees have to have some of these bacteria, so you have a system where this relationship serves the biology of both the bacteria and the host. And it gets to a point where it’s **obligatory adj. 义务的；必须的；义不容辞的，强制性的**, so one cannot exist without the other.”

“蜜蜂必须有一些这样的细菌，这种微生物群服务于细菌和宿主。在某种程度上，它们互不分离。

Being able to **distinguish** nest mates from invaders is absolutely critical, Ben-Shahar says.

本-沙哈尔说，能够区分巢穴同伴和入侵者绝对是至关重要的。

Without that ability, bees would be vulnerable to nest **parasites**—and to other bees looking to steal their most precious commodity: honey. And so the **entrance fee** must be paid—not in dollars but in scents.

如果没有这种能力，蜜蜂就很容易受到巢内寄生虫的攻击，也容易受到其他想要偷走它们蜂蜜的蜜蜂的攻击。因此，入场费必须支付——不是美元，而是气味。


科学美国人60秒：甜甜圈中的糖有助于延长血液保存时间

This is Scientific American's 60-second Science, I'm Susanne Bard

这里是科学美国人——60秒科学系列，我是苏珊娜·巴德。

***Blood donations*** save lives. But blood can only ***be stored under refrigeration*** for up to six weeks. After that, it's no longer usable for ***transfusions***.

献血可以挽救生命。但是血液最多只能冷藏保存6周。之后，就无法再用于***输血***。

"Because of that limitation, people have to continually donate blood to meet the needs. But also, in places where refrigeration may not be available, that can also be a challenge. It's difficult to have blood available when needed."

“因为这个限制，人们必须不断献血以满足需求。但在可能没有冷藏的地方，这也是个挑战。在有需要时很难有血液供应。”

University of Louisville bioengineer Jonathan Kopechek. He says **disruptions to** regular blood donations due to COVID-19 have **put stress on** the blood supply, and the pandemic **underscores** the need for more reliable long-term storage methods. Blood can be frozen for extended periods of time...

路易斯维尔大学的生物工程师乔纳森·科佩奇说到。他表示，新冠肺炎导致的定期献血中断，给血液供应带来了压力，而且这场疫情**凸显**出人们对更可靠的长期储存方法的需求。血液可以长时间冷冻……

"But it's pretty rare because of all the challenges and complexities with that process."

“但这非常罕见，因为这一过程存在种种挑战和复杂问题。”

Instead Kopechek's team has developed a method of preserving blood so it can be stored in a dehydrated state **at room temperature**. To do so, they turned to an unusual **preservative**: a sugar called trehalose, which is a common ingredient in donuts...

相反，科佩奇的研究团队开发出一种保存血液的方法，使其可以在室温下以脱水状态保存。为此，他们找到了一种不同寻常的防腐剂：海藻糖，这种糖是甜甜圈中的常见配料……

"To help make them look fresh even when they might be months old, and you wouldn't know the difference."

“这种糖有助于让甜甜圈看起来很新鲜，即使已经是几个月以前的甜甜圈，你也不会知道有何区别。”

The researchers chose trehalose because, in nature, it's made by **hardy** animals like tardigrades and sea monkeys—aka brine shrimp—famous for their ability to survive dehydration.

研究人员选择海藻糖是的原因是，它来自自然界中沙蜥蜴和海猴(又称卤虫)等坚韧动物，它们都以脱水生存能力而闻名。

"So these animals can **dry out** completely for a long period of time and then be rehydrated and resume normal function. So we wanted to use the trehalose that's produced by these organisms and apply that to preserving blood cells in a dried state, just like those organisms are."

“因此，这些动物可以完全**脱水**相当长一段时间，还能再水合并恢复正常功能。因此，我们想用这些生物产生的海藻糖，将血液细胞保持在干燥状态存储，就像这些生物一样。””

But first, the researchers had to get trehalose into blood cells. They used ultrasound to **drill** temporary holes in the **cell membranes ['mem.breɪn]**—which let some trehalose get in.

但首先，研究人员必须让海藻糖进入血细胞。他们用超声波在细胞膜上钻出临时小孔，让一些海藻糖进入。

"And they need to have sufficient levels of trehalose on both the inside and the outside of the cell in order to survive the dehydration and rehydration process."

“他们要让细胞内外保持足够的海藻糖水平，才能让细胞在脱水和再水合过程中存活下来。”

At that point, the blood could be dried and made into a powder.

这种情况下，就可以将血液干燥并制成粉末。

"And then we can rehydrate the blood and have it return back to normal."

“之后，我们就可以让血液再水合，将其恢复正常。

The team is still trying to **improve yields** but thinks the dried blood could be stored at room temperature for years. The study is in the journal Biomicrofluidics.

该团队仍在努力提高产量，但他们认为干燥血液可以在室温下储存多年。这项研究发表在《生物微流体》期刊上。

Kopechek says the technique could be ready for **clinical trials** in three to five years. If successful, it could be used to create stores of dried blood in case of future pandemics or natural disasters—and for **humanitarian aid** work, military operations or even missions to Mars. Maybe **first aid kits** on the Red Planet will include dried red blood cells.

科佩奇表示，这项技术可以在三到五年内做好**临床试验**的准备。如果成功，这项技术就可以在未来发生疫情或自然灾害等情况下建立干燥血液储存，或者是用于人道主义援助工作、军事行动，甚至是火星任务。或许，那颗红色星球(指火星)上的急救包里，会有这种干燥的血红细胞。

科学美国人60秒：小仓鸮通过分享来互相帮助

This is Scientific American's 60-second Science. I'm Jason Goldman.

这里是科学美国人——60秒科学。我是杰森·古德曼。

**Robin Hood famously stole from the rich and gave to the poor**. Young, newly hatched barn owls do something similar.

**罗宾汉以劫富济贫而闻名**。刚孵化小的仓鸮也会做类似的事情。

On average, barn owls raise six chicks at once—and sometimes as many as nine. But they don't all hatch at the same time, which means the older **owlets 小猫头鹰** are generally larger and healthier than their younger brothers and sisters.

平均来说，仓鸮一次养育6只雏鸟，有时能达到9只。但它们不会同时孵化所有雏鸟，也就是说年长的仓鸮通常比年幼的弟弟妹妹体型更大、身体更健康。

As long as the little owls remain in the nest, they're completely dependent on their parents for food. The problem is that the small **rodents** that they eat can't be **split up**. So when Mom or Dad returns to the nest to feed their offspring, only one chick can eat **a time**.

只要小仓鸮还待在巢里，它们就能完全依赖父母喂食。问题是它们吃的小**啮齿动物**不能被**分开**。因此，当仓鸮父母回到巢中喂养雏鸟时，一次只能喂一只雏鸟。

In many bird species, the oldest would simply **outcompete** the youngest, but barn owls are different. Turns out the older, healthier birds sometimes donate their meals to their hungrier **siblings**.

在大多数鸟类中，最年长的鸟能轻松**战胜**最年轻的鸟，但仓鸮则不同。事实表明，年长、健康的仓鸮有时会将自已的食物捐给饥饿的**兄弟姐妹**。

Adults in other animals species share their food.

其它成年动物会分享食物。

"It's mainly observed when males want to reproduce with females, so there (are) many (exchanges) of food. Or in primates, there (are) many (exchanges) of food and grooming but only in adults."

“这种行为主要在雄性想和雌性繁殖时能观察到，因此会有许多食物交换。还有灵长类动物会用食物交换梳毛，但这仅存在于成年动物之间。”

Evolutionary biologist Pauline Ducouret from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland.

瑞士洛桑大学的进化生物学家保林·迪库雷说到。

"And in chicks, it is really rarely observed. So it's quite impressive that in this species, there are so many cooperative behaviors."

“我们极少在雏鸟身上观察到这种行为。因此，令人印象相当深刻的是，仓鸮这一物种存在如此多的合作行为。”

She and her team wanted to know how this unique behavior evolved. It could be explained by the direct benefits gained through cooperation, such as trading food for grooming. Or it could be explained by the indirect benefits gained from helping others that share your genetic heritage—also known as kin selection.

她和团队想知道这种独特行为的进化方式。这可能是因为它们可以通过合作获得直接利益，比如用食物交换梳毛。或者因为它们能通过帮助有共同遗传基因的同类来获得间接利益，也就是亲缘选择。

They found that the answer was both. Younger birds groomed older ones more often than older ones groomed the youngsters. And in return, the older birds fed their younger siblings. In addition, older owlets preferentially offered food to their hungriest siblings, even in the absence of grooming.

他们发现答案是两者兼而有之。就仓鸮而言，年幼者为年长者梳毛的频率要高于年长者为年幼者梳毛的频率。作为回报，年长仓鸮会喂食弟弟妹妹。此外，即使没有梳毛作为交换，年长者仓鸮也更愿意为最饥饿的兄弟姐妹提供食物。

But food sharing only happened when the researchers artificially provisioned the owlets with extra food. So it's not that the owls risked their own survival to help their siblings. But when there was more than enough to go around, they shared instead of hoarding. The results are in the journal the American Naturalist.

但只有当研究人员人为地为仓鸮提供额外食物时，它们才会分享食物。因此，并不是说仓鸮冒着生存危险去帮助它们的兄弟姐妹。但是，在食物有富余时，它们就会分享，而不是贮藏。这项研究发表在《美国博物学家》期刊上。

Ducouret says that evolutionary biologists usually characterize sibling relationships as competitive or even antagonistic. But remarkably complex examples of cooperation can still be found among animal brothers and sisters. Seems that even newly hatched barn owls know that sharing is caring.

迪库雷表示，进化生物学家通常认为兄弟姐妹关系是竞争性甚至是敌对的。但在动物兄弟姐妹之间仍然可以找到非常复杂的合作例子。似乎连刚孵出的仓鸮都知道分享就是关心。
