For African Elephants, Pee Could Be a Potent Trail Marker

Christopher Intagliata: We humans often navigate using road signs and GPS. Elephants, though?

克里斯托弗·因塔利亚塔:我们人类经常使用路标和GPS导航。大象呢?

Connie Allen, a **behavioral ecologist** at the University of Exeter in the U.K., says they **navigate over long distances** using their incredible memories. (An elephant never forgets, right?)

英国埃克塞特大学的行为生态学家康妮·艾伦说，它们利用难以置信的记忆力进行长距离导航。(大象永远不会忘记吗?)

Connie Allen: But it’s also been suggested here and there that maybe **olfaction** and sense of smell is critical to these long-distance movements.

康妮·艾伦:但也有人指出，也许**嗅觉**和气味对大象的远距离迁徙至关重要。

Intagliata: Allen and her colleagues investigated that idea by testing African elephants’ ability to **tune in收音，开始** on a very specific smell: urine. You see, elephants pee a lot—some 12 to 15 gallons a day --and that urine can contain an array of chemical cues.

印塔利亚塔:艾伦和同事们通过测试非洲象对一种非常特殊的气味——尿液——的感知能力来进行研究。你看，大象尿的量很大——每天大约12到15加仑——这些尿液中可能含有一系列的化学信号。

But first, they needed some pee. So they headed to a spot along Botswana’s Boteti River and waited.

但首先，大象需要上厕所。因此，它们前往博茨瓦纳博泰提河沿岸的一个地方等待。

Allen: We’d wait for elephants to **urinate** and, within 20 minutes, go and collect these fresh urine samples.

艾伦:我们会等大象排尿，然后在20分钟内去收集这些新鲜的尿液样本。

Intagliata: Then they set up camera traps on seven elephant trails. After observing the elephants’ natural behavior on the paths, they noticed that a majority investigated scents along the trail—especially elephants traveling alone—an indication, the researchers say, that scents may serve as **signposts*** along the trail.

印塔利亚塔:然后他们在7条大象的踪迹上设置了摄像头陷阱。在观察了大象在道路上的自然行为后，他们注意到，大多大象会注意道路上的气味——尤其是独自旅行的大象——研究人员说，这表明气味可以作为道路上的路标。

Next, they placed those urine samples along the trails. And they found that for at least two days, passing elephants trained their **trunks** on the samples—especially samples from mature adults—another indication that scent might be a **potent** navigational cue.

接下来，他们把这些尿液样本放在路边。结果发现，在至少两天的时间里，经过的大象用它们的鼻子对着这些样本——尤其是成年大象的样本——进行嗅，这是气味可能是一个**有力的**导航线索的另一个迹象。

Their findings appear in the journal Animal Behaviour.

他们的研究结果发表在《动物行为》杂志上。

Based on these results, they hope **conservationists** might be able to use elephant pee as a **decoy 美[dɪ'kɔɪ]**.

基于这些结果，他们希望**环保人士**可以利用大象的尿液作为**诱饵**。

Allen: If we can **trick elephants into thinking** the path of other elephants is going this way, maybe we can redirect them away from it at the moment where they are coming into conflict with humans.

艾伦:如果我们能欺骗大象，让它们认为其他大象会走这条路，也许我们就能在它们与人类发生冲突的时候改变它们的方向。

Intagliata: They’ll just have to see what happens, once elephants **get a whiff of that plan**.

印塔利亚塔:他们只想知道一旦大象**知道了这个计划**，接下来会发生什么。

**get a whiff of (something)**
1. Literally, to experience a faint odor or scent.
Yuck, I just got a whiff of dog poop. Did anyone step in any on the way home?
I think I'm getting a whiff of garlic from the broth—is that correct?
2. To receive an extremely small portion or sample of something desirable.
Health insurance, a company phone, and a pension plan? Man, I didn't get a whiff of benefits like those when I was working for the company.
He didn't patent the design, so he won't get a whiff of the money they're making on it.
3. To receive a very small amount of information, especially just enough to give someone an indication or inkling of something.
