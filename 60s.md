### For African Elephants, Pee Could Be a Potent Trail Marker ###
尿液作为大象行走的标记

Christopher Intagliata: We humans often navigate using road signs and GPS. Elephants, though?

克里斯托弗·因塔利亚塔:我们人类经常使用路标和GPS导航。大象呢?

Connie Allen, a **behavioral ecologist** at the University of Exeter in the U.K., says they **navigate over long distances** using their incredible memories. (An elephant never forgets, right?)

英国埃克塞特大学的行为生态学家康妮·艾伦说，它们利用难以置信的记忆力进行长距离导航。(大象永远不会忘记吗?)

Connie Allen: But it’s also been suggested here and there that maybe **olfaction** and sense of smell is critical to these long-distance movements.

康妮·艾伦:但也有人指出，也许**嗅觉**和气味对大象的远距离迁徙至关重要。

Intagliata: Allen and her colleagues investigated that idea by testing African elephants’ ability to tune in on a very specific smell: urine. You see, elephants pee a lot—some 12 to 15 gallons a day --and that urine can contain an array of chemical cues.
